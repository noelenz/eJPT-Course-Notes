# Vulnerabilities
  
NIST definition:
A weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentality, integrity or availability.

# Nessus Lab
In this lab we will use Nessus to scan and perform vulnerability analysis of a target machine running an instance of Mutillidae web application.

This exercise will help to understand how to perform vulnerability scanning using Nessus.

## Relevant Information:
- username: admin
- password: adminpasswd

## Tools:
- Nessus
- web browser

### Performing vulnerability scan on the target machine using Nessus.

In the browser we type in: https://localhost:8834

Then we login with our above credentials.

Now we scan the target machine using Nessus:

In this particular scan, 2 medium severity vulnerabilities were discovered. To get more details about the vulnerabilities, we click on the horizontal colored bar containing the vulnerabilities of different severity and their respective counts.

To get more info about a vulnerability, we can click on it:

This page shows us the vulnerability name, it's severity, a short description, a remediation strategy, related advisories/links.

The output section on the same page might show us the steps or the URL to exploit or confirm the vulnerability as well:

### Download the vulnerabilities report for the basic network scan

On the top right corner, we can download our Vulnerability scan in form of a report:

### Performing a custom scan using Nessus.

We want to create a custom Scan using "Advanced Scan" under the category "My Scans".
We filled in our credentials, and after that we changed the "Discovery" "Host Discovery" settings:

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39f109c8-10cb-4989-992d-65a3fed721e5)

Now we change the DISCOVERY -> Port Scanning settings
Here we check the TCP box to perform a more accurate scan

Under "GENERAL" we check the Perform thorough tests (may disrupt our network or impact scan speed) option:

Under "WEB APPLICATIONS" we want our scan to perform a web application scan:

### Run the configured scan:

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a06f4d7-dc62-4303-b0da-9ef95c5529c4)

We can see our Vulnerabilities: 

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/814b90c2-0276-4973-acf1-45b2609614de)

We enumerated a URL:

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d91611bc-ed42-40bf-973f-39fb8373f08e)

We also check out another interesting vulnerability:

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c6c8089-94f9-46d2-bbbb-a235ebc419c1)

This git repository actually exists:

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2572f7c-b0ba-4f94-961d-de331e43d877)

We also could export this Scan in form of a report.

# Vulnerability Assessment

## Types of Windows Vulnerabilities 

- **Infomation disclosure** - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to access confidental data
- **Buffer overflows** - Caused by a programming error, allows attackers to write data to a buffer and overrun the allocated buffer, consequently writing data to acllocated memory addresses.
- **Remote code execution** - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to remotely execute code on the target system.
- **Privilege escalation** - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to elevate their privileges after initial compromise.
- **Denial of Service (DOS)** - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to consume a system/host's resources (CPU, RAM, Network etc.) consequently preventing the system from functioning normally.

## Frequently Exploited Windows Services
