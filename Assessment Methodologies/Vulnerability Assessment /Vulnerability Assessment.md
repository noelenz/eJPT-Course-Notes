# Vulnerabilities
  
NIST definition:
A weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentality, integrity or availability.

# Nessus Lab
In this lab we will use Nessus to scan and perform vulnerability analysis of a target machine running an instance of Mutillidae web application.

This exercise will help to understand how to perform vulnerability scanning using Nessus.
