#### Post-Exploitation

- Post-exploitation is the final phase of the pentest process and consists of the tactics, techniques and procedures that attackers/adversaries undertake after obtaining initial access on a target system.

- Post-exploitation will differ based on the target operating system as well as the target infrastructure.
