# Exploiting Windows

## Exploiting a Vulnerable HTTP File Server

- An HTTP File Servier (HFS) is a web server that is designed for file & document sharing.
- HTTP File Servers typically run on TCP port 80 and utilize the HTTP protocol for underlying communication.
- Rejetto HFS is a popular free and open source HTTP file server that can be setup on both Windows and Linux.
- Rejetto HFS V2.3 is vulnerable to a remote command execution attack.
- MSF has an exploit module that we can utilize to gain access to the target system hosting the HFS.
