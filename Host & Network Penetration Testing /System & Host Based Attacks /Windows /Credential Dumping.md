# Windows Password Hashes
- The Windows OS stores hashed user account passwords locally in the SAM (Security Accounts Manager) database.
- Hashing is the process of converting a piece of data into another value. A hashing function or algorithm is used to generate the new value. The result of a hashing algorithm is known as a hash or hash value.
- Authentication and verification of user credentials is facilitated by the Local Security Authority (LSA)
- Windows versions up to Windows Server 2003 utilize two different types of hashes:
  - LM
  - NTLM
- Windows disables LM hashing and utilizes NTLM hashing from Windows Vista onwards.

## SAM Database
- SAM (Security Account Manager) is a database file that is responsible for managing user accounts and passwords on Windows. All user account passwords stored in the SAM database are hashed.
- The SAM database file cannot be copied while the OS is running.
- The Windows NT kernel keeps the SAM database file locked and as a result, attackers typically utilize in-memory techniques and tools to dump SAM hashes from the LSASS process.
- In modern versions of Windows, the SAM database is encrypted with a syskey.
- Administrative privileges are required in order to access and interact with the LSASS proces.
