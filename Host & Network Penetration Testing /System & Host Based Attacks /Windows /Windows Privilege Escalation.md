# Windows Kernel Exploits

## Privilege Escalation
- Privilege Escalation involves exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to elevate access from a standard user to one with administrative or root privileges.
- This is critical in a penetration test to gain full control of a system after an initial compromise.
- Once a foothold is gained, escalating privileges allows you to perform tasks that require higher-level access.

## Windows Kernel
- The Kernel is the core component of an operating system, managing system resources and hardware interactions.
- **Windows NT Kernel**: Used by all versions of Microsoft Windows, with two main operation modes:
  - **User Mode**: Limited access to system resources, typically for standard applications and services.
  - **Kernel Mode**: Full access to system resources, used by the OS to manage hardware and execute critical system functions.
  
- Exploiting the Windows kernel allows code execution with the highest system privileges, potentially leading to full control over the target system.

## Windows Kernel Exploitation
- **Targeting Vulnerabilities**: Windows kernel exploits focus on specific vulnerabilities to execute code with elevated privileges.
- **Privilege Escalation Process**:
  - Identify kernel vulnerabilities.
  - Download, compile, and transfer kernel exploits to the target system.

## Tools & Environment:
- **Windows Exploit Suggester**: Compares the target's patch levels against a vulnerability database to detect missing patches and potential exploits.
- **Windows-Kernel-Exploits**: A collection of Windows Kernel exploits sorted by CVE.

## Demo

# Bypassing UAC With UACMe

- **User Account Control (UAC)**: A Windows security feature introduced in Windows Vista to prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system. It ensures that changes require approval from an administrator or a user in the local administrators group.
- A non-privileged user executing a program with elevated privileges will see a UAC prompt, while a privileged user will see a consent prompt.
- Bypassing UAC allows execution of malicious executables with elevated privileges.

## Bypassing UAC
- Access to a user account in the local administrators group is needed.
- UAC can execute programs with administrative privileges but may prompt for confirmation depending on its integrity level setting.
- The technique and tools used to bypass UAC depend on the Windows version.

## Bypassing UAC With UACME
- **UACMe**: An open-source tool used to bypass Windows UAC through various methods. The GitHub repository provides exploits for Windows 7 to Windows 10.
- It enables the execution of payloads with administrative privileges by abusing the Windows AutoElevate feature.
- The repository contains over 60 exploits for bypassing UAC, depending on the Windows version.

# Access Token Impersonation

## Windows Access Tokens
- Windows access tokens are a core elemt of the authentication process on Windows and are created and managed by the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)
- A Windows access token is responsible for identifying and describing the security context of a process or thread running on a system. An access token can be thought of as a temporary key akin to a web cookie that provides users with access to a target system or network resource without having to provide credentials each time a process is started or a system resource is accessed.
- Access tokens are generated by the winlogon.exe process every time a user authenticated successfully and includes the identity and privileges of the user account associated with the thread or process. This token is then attached to the userinit.exe process, after which all child processes started by a user will inherit a copy of the access token from their creator and will run under the privileges of the same access token.
- Windows access tokens are categorized based on the varying security levels assigned to them. These security levels are used to determine the privileges that are assigned to a specific token.
- An access token will typically be assigned to one of the following security levels
  - Impersonate-level tokens are created as a direct result of a non-interactive login on Windows, typically through specific system services or domain logons.
  - Delegate-level tokens are typically created through an interactive login on Windows, primarly thorugh a traditional login or through remote access protocols such as RDP
- Impersonate level tokens can be used to impersonate a token on the local system and not on any external systems that utilize the token.
- Delegate-level tokens pose the largest threat as they can be used to impersonate tokens on any system.

## Windows Privileges
- The process of impersonating access tokens to elevate privileges on a system will primarly depend on the privileges assigned to the account that has been exploited to gain initial access as well as the impersonation or delegation tokens available.
- The following are the privileges that are required for a successful impersonation attack:
  - SeAssignPrimaryToken: Allows a user to impersonate tokens.
  - SeCreateToken: Allows a user to create an arbitrary token with administrative privileges.
  - SemlpersonatePrivilege: Allows a user to create a process under the security context of another user typically with administrative privileges.
