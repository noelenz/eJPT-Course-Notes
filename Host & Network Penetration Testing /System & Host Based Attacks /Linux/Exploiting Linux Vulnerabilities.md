# Exploiting Bash CVE-20214-6271 Vulnerability (Shellshock)

- Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271) is s family of vulnerabilites in the Bash shell (since V1.3) that allow an attacker to execute remote arbitrary commands via Bash, consequently allwing the attacker to obtain remote access to the target system via a reverse shell.
- The Shellshock vulnerability is caused by a vulnerability in Bash, whereby Bash mistakenly executes trailing commands after a series of characters: () {:;};.
- Only affects Linux (not Windows)
- In context of remote exploitation, Apache web servers configured to run CGI scripts or .sh scripts are also vulnerable to this attack.
- CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts are used by Apache to execute arbitrary commands on the Linux system, after which the output is displayed to the client.
  
- In order to exploit this vulnerability, we need to locate a input vector or script that allows you to communicate with Bash
- In the context of an Apache web server, we can utilize any legitimate CGI scripts accessible on the web server.
- Whenever a CGI script is executed, the web server will initiate a new process and run the CGI script with bash.
- This vulnerability can be exploited both manually and automatically with the use of an MSF exploit module.
