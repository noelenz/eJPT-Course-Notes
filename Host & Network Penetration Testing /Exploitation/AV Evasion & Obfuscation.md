## AV Evasion With Shellter

### Defense Evasion

Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection thoroughout their compromise. Techiques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or **obfuscating/encrypting** data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware. -MITRE 

### AV Detection Methods

AV software will typically utilize signature, heuristic and behaviour based detection.

1. Signature based detection - An AV signature is a unique sequence of bytes that uniquely identifies malware. As a result, you will have to ensure that your obfuscated exploit or payload doesn't match any known signature in the AV database.

We can bypass signature-based detection by modifying the malware's byte sequence, therefore changing the signature.

2. Heuristic-based detection - Relies on rules or decisions to determine whether a binary is malicious. It also looks for specific patterns withing the code or program calls.
3. Behaviour based detection - Relies on identifying malware by monitoring it's behaviour (Used for newer strains of malware).
