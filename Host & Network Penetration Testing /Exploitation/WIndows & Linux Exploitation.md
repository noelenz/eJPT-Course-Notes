## Windows Black Box Penetration Test

- A Black box pentest is a security assessment whereby the pentester is not provided with any information regarding the target system or network.
- The objective ob a Black Box pentest is to accurately test the security of a system or network as an external unprivileged adversary.
- This approach is very useful as it demonstrates how an external attacker with no inside knowledge would compromise a company's systems or networks

The following diagram outlines the various phases involved in a typical penetration test.

### Scenario & Scope

- We just began our first job as Junior Pentester and have been assigned to assist in performing a pentest on a client's network.
- The pentest lead has assigned us to gain access/exploit a host running Windows Server 2008.
- Our primary objectives are:
  - Identify services running on the target
  - Identify vulnerabilites within the service
  - Exploit these vulnerabilities to obtain an initial foothold
